                <p>Service was conceived as a convenient place to store all of your information about your
                    Steamâ„¢ profile. What for? It's a long question. We wanted to collect all the information
                    in one place, so that the user does not "jumping" from one service to another.</p>
                <p>Statsmile is hobby. So everything here is created exclusively on the enthusiasm and desire to learn.</p>
                <p>Developer team.</p>
