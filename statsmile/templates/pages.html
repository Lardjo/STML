        <p>
        After the update of 26 July 2013 Valve shut off by default view statistics of user. In order to allow us to
        collect your data, you need to enable sharing matches in the Dota 2 client. To do this, run your Steam, Dota 2 clients
        and enable "Share Match History" on game settings page.</p>
        <h3>When I want login on this site, required to enter a login and password Steam. You want steal my data!?</h3>
        <p>No!.. Registration through the official website Steam with Steam ID auth. We only get your unique
            profile ID and nothing more. We don't need your hats.</p>
        <h3>Where is my winrate?</h3>
        <p>Due to impossibility to obtain these parameters more precisely, they are temporarily removed from the site.</p>
        {% elif title == "Status" %}
